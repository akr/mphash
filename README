== Feature

* generate a minimal perfect hash function
* generate a C source code
  * generated source code is public domain
  * several module structures supported
    * single source file for self-contained command (testing purpose)
    * foo.c and foo.h pair for single hash function 
    * mphash.h, mphash.c, foo.h, foo.c, bar.h, bar.c, ... for multiple
      hash functions

== Usage

=== Hash Function

You need a file which contains keys.

  % cat keyfile
  foo
  bar
  baz
  qux
  quux
  corge
  grault
  garply
  waldo
  fred
  plugh
  xyzzy
  thud

mphash command generate a self-contained C source code as follows.
It is just compilable.

  % mphash keyfile -o hash.c
  % gcc hash.c

The binary compiled shows hash value for each keys.
mphash assigned 0 to 12 for the 13 keys.

  % ./a.out 
  12 "foo"
  2 "bar"
  5 "baz"
  7 "qux"
  1 "quux"
  11 "corge"
  6 "grault"
  0 "garply"
  3 "waldo"
  4 "fred"
  9 "plugh"
  10 "xyzzy"
  8 "thud"

The binary shows hash values for specified arguments.

  % ./a.out foo baz thud
  12
  5
  8

It is not an error to specify a non-key string.
The hash function returns 4294967295 or some value in the assigned range (0-12).
4294967295 means the string is not a key.
However a value in the range doesn't mean the string is a key.

  % ./a.out a aaaa  
  4294967295
  3
