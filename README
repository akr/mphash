== Feature

* generate a minimal perfect hash function
* generate a C source code
  * generated source code is public domain
  * several module structures supported
    * single source file for self-contained command (testing purpose)
    * foo.c and foo.h pair for single hash function 
    * mphash.h, mphash.c, foo.h, foo.c, bar.h, bar.c, ... for multiple
      hash functions

== Usage

=== Hash Function

You need a file which contains keys.

  % cat keyfile
  foo
  bar
  baz
  qux
  quux
  corge
  grault
  garply
  waldo
  fred
  plugh
  xyzzy
  thud

mphash command generate a self-contained C source code as follows.
It is just compilable.

  % mphash keyfile -o hash.c
  % gcc hash.c

The binary compiled shows hash value for each keys.
mphash assigned 0 to 12 for the 13 keys.

  % ./a.out 
  12 "foo"
  2 "bar"
  5 "baz"
  7 "qux"
  1 "quux"
  11 "corge"
  6 "grault"
  0 "garply"
  3 "waldo"
  4 "fred"
  9 "plugh"
  10 "xyzzy"
  8 "thud"

The binary shows hash values for specified arguments.

  % ./a.out foo baz thud
  12
  5
  8

It is not an error to specify a non-key string.
The hash function returns 4294967295 or some value in the assigned range (0-12).
4294967295 means the string is not a key.
However a value in the range doesn't mean the string is a key.

  % ./a.out a aaaa  
  4294967295
  3

mphash can be used for large key sets, /usr/share/dict/words for example.
The 98568 words in the file are mapped to integers 0 to 98567. 

  % wc -w /usr/share/dict/words
  98568 /usr/share/dict/words
  % mphash /usr/share/dict/words -o words.c
  % gcc words.c 
  % ./a.out|sort -n|tail
  98558 "licorice's"
  98559 "neodymium's"
  98560 "Nader's"
  98561 "begotten"
  98562 "Tehran"
  98563 "spunks"
  98564 "druids"
  98565 "glowworms"
  98566 "moralizes"
  98567 "verdigris's"

=== Module Options

  # self-contained test command
  #
  mphash -o command.c keyfile                   # source code including main

  # single hash function
  #
  # uint32_t mphf(const void *key, size_t length) is defined.
  # The default function name is mphf.  It is overrided by -n option.
  #
  mphash -fH [-n funcname] -o hash.h            # header
  mphash -f [-n funcname] -o hash.h keyfile     # funcname definition

  # multiple hash functions (default data name is mphf_param)
  #
  # uint32_t mphash_generic(const void *key, size_t length, const mphash_func_t *param)
  # is defined by mphash.c.
  # const mphash_func_t *mphf_param is defined for each key.
  # The default parameter name is mphf_param. -n option override it.
  # mphash_generic(key, length, mphf_param) returns a hash value.
  #
  mphash -fcH -o mphash.h                       # common header
  mphash -fc -o mphash.c                        # code for hash functions
  mphash -fdH [-n dataname] -o hdata.h          # header for hash parameter
  mphash -fd [-n dataname] -o hdata.h keyfile   # hash parameter
